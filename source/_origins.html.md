## Origins

One of the worst feelings in the game of Magic is looking down at a card or board state and knowing you don't have a way to beat it. I loathe this feeling enough that it has guided my play and deckbuilding, which means that I end up running many controlling and defensive decks. Understandably, not everyone in my playgroup is excited to play against decks like this, at least not all the time. This deck started as a response to my playgroup and a challenge to myself: could I build a deck that satisfied my desire to answer every board state but without actually removing any of my opponent's threats, unless absolutely necessary?

I did my due diligence and tried to find decks built with a similar strategy, and came across [this Tariel list](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/multiplayer-commander-decklists/490546-tariel-youll-thank-me-for-this) from Rachmiel. The motivations are similar, but my list varies enough that I believe it warrants its own explanation. Nevertheless, I owe Rachmiel a thank you for their thoughtful primer which got me started down this road properly.


## Goals

The goal of this deck is to pose no threat to anybody in the early to mid-game, then close the match out in sudden and dramatic fashion by taking the most powerful aspects of our opponent's decks and using them to our benefit. This strategy scales well. In many cases the more tuned our opponent's deck the easier time we'll have dispatching them. It plays into something I've found to be instrinsic to the format: games that consistently excalate before ending dramatically with big combos and powerful cards.

A note about the early game: I think it's important to understand the true virtue running defensive cards and not playing early threats. Some people seem to consider this strategy a trick &mdash; something your opponents may fall for once or twice but will eventually expect and play around by attacking you regardless. This assessment is incorrect and it directly affects how you evaluate cards when deckbuilding and decisions when you're playing. When you run a card like Ghostly Prison or No Mercy, you're not trying to decieve your opponent into thinking it's a bad idea to attack you, you're actually making attacking you a strategically bad choice.

Unless the table is at perfect parity, there is always a player who is behind, a player who is ahead, and some number of players in the middle, depending on the size of the pod. This deck aims to be the player that is behind. Like defensive cards, this is not a trick: we will _actually_ be behind. Our board will not be developed, our hand will be middling, and even with our defensive cards, we'll genuinely be susceptible. This is where it becomes important to understand the mentality of our opponents.

First, let's consider the player in the lead. They are motivated to end the game while they are in the lead if possible, or prevent their lead from slipping away if they cannot win immediately. If they're winning by a lot, they may execute their plan equally against all of their opponents, essentially turning it into a x-on-1 situation. I say "execute their plan" instead of something seemingly simpler, like "attack", because not every deck wants to attack. It's important to understand what winning looks like from different perspectives. I have observed many inexperienced players underestimate the blue player with 12 cards in hand and no board presence to speak of. Some decks, like combo decks, can't help but execute their plan equally. As they get closer to assembling their winning pieces, each of their opponents gets equally closer to losing the game.


## Choosing Color Identity

I began as I begin most lists, by collecting cards with effects I knew I wanted to play. It became clear that I had to run at least white and red. They provided the protection and the swingy, powerful effects necessary for a deck like this to work.
